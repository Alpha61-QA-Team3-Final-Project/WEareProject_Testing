## Project Description

The WEareProject is a Social Network web application developed to enable users to connect and interact with others in meaningful ways. The application provides core social networking features, such as:

- **Creating and Interacting with Posts**: Users can create posts, comment on them, and express their appreciation by liking posts.

Whether it is focused on connecting travelers with reviews and experiences, helping students stay in touch, or generating a personalized feed similar to popular social networks, the application aims to provide a versatile platform for connection and interaction.
